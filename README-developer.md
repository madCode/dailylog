# dailyLog Developer Documentation

This document provides instructions for setting up a development environment and building the dailyLog application.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio (recommended) or command-line tools
- JDK 21 / OpenJDK 21 (required for building)
- Kotlin SDK 2.2.10 (as specified in build.gradle)
- Android SDK with API level 36
- Gradle 8.0 or higher

## Setting Up Development Environment Using Android Studio

Download the latest version of Android Studio.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madCode/dailylog.git
   cd dailylog
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory

3. **Sync the project**:
   - Android Studio will automatically sync Gradle files
   - If prompted, accept any SDK or build tool updates

4. **Run all tests:**
   - Under `app/src` locate the two test folders: `test` (unit tests) and `androidTest` (instrumentation tests).
   - In Android Studio, right click on each folder and click on "Run 'All Tests'" (Ctrl + Shift + R)
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Common issues:
     - If it's been a while since the app was updated, the current Gradle version may be incompatible with the latest version of Android Studio.
     - Android Studio won't build the app until this is resolved, this may impact running tests or building the debug version (step 5)
     - To resolve, follow the instructions in Android Studio to upgrade the Gradle and relevant library versions and put up a pull request.

5. **Debug build the project**:
   - In the top right-hand corner in Android studio:
      - select a device
      - select "app"
      - click on the green play button
   - Ensure the app builds with no errors
      - the debug apk is stored in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
   - In the device, play around with the app

6. **madCode only**: Set up signing key for releases
   - Locate the `dailylog.jks` keystore file.
   - Add the following secrets to the GitHub repository (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**):

   | Secret | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded keystore: `base64 -i dailylog.jks \| pbcopy` |
   | `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
   | `KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias |
   | `KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |

   - In Android Studio, go to **Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle → Gradle JDK** and select `openjdk-21`.

## Releasing a New App Version

### Part 1: Tag a New Release

1. **Update version information in `app/build.gradle`**:
   ```gradle
   defaultConfig {
       applicationId "com.app.dailylog"
       minSdkVersion 23
       targetSdkVersion 36
       versionCode 3001  // Increment this number
       versionName "3.0.1"  // Update to new semantic version
   }
   ```

2. **Commit and tag**:
   ```bash
   git add app/build.gradle
   git commit -m "Release version 3.0.1"
   git tag -a v3.0.1 -m "Release version 3.0.1"
   git push origin v3.0.1
   ```

3. **Pushing the tag** triggers the `release` GitHub Actions workflow, which builds a signed APK and creates the GitHub Release page with the APK attached automatically.
   - **Note:** The four keystore secrets must be configured in the repository (see setup step 6 above) before this will work.
   - **Important:** F-Droid requires APKs, not App Bundles — the workflow is already configured to produce an APK.

4. **Add release notes manually**: once the workflow completes, go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/madCode/dailylog/releases), edit the new release, and fill in the title and description/changelog before publishing.

### Part 2: Ensuring a Successful F-Droid Release

You can read about F-Droid's update process [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/wiki/-/wikis/FAQ#finding-updates). This page also links to where you can see the latest builds and releases.

After publishing a new release, wait at least 24 hours, then check the following:
1. The [DailyLog F-Droid page](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.app.dailylog/): see if the version at the bottom matches the new version.
2. If not, check the [metadata file](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/com.app.dailylog.yml?ref_type=heads): see if F-Droid successfully updated the version number.
3. If not, search [existing dailyLog merge requests](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/?sort=created_date&state=opened&search=dailyLog&first_page_size=20): see if the check-updates bot had issues and if anyone is working on it

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Running Instrumentation Tests
```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

### Running Coverage Reports
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
./gradlew koverHtmlReport

# Generate XML coverage report  
./gradlew koverXmlReport

# Verify coverage requirements
./gradlew koverVerify
```
- Report Locations
  - HTML: `app/build/reports/kover/html/index.html`
  - XML: `app/build/reports/kover/xml/report.xml`

### Pre-commit Hook
The pre-commit hook automatically runs when committing code:
1. Runs unit tests with coverage instrumentation
2. Generates Kover HTML and XML reports
3. Displays report locations and OS-specific open instructions

## Code Style and Formatting

### Kotlin Formatting
- Uses Kotlin 2.2.10 (from build.gradle)
- Follows Kotlin code style "official" as specified in gradle.properties

### Android Project Structure
The project follows standard Android conventions:
- `app/src/main/java/com/app/dailylog/` - Main application code
- `app/src/main/res/` - Resources (layouts, drawables, strings)
- `app/src/test/java/` - Unit tests
- `app/src/androidTest/java/` - Instrumentation tests

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes following the code style
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Run all tests to ensure no regressions
6. Submit a pull request

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build failures with Java version**:
   - Ensure JDK 21 (OpenJDK 21) is installed and set as the Gradle JDK in Android Studio (**Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle → Gradle JDK**)
   - On macOS with Homebrew: `brew install openjdk@21`, then symlink it: `sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-21.jdk`

2. **Permission issues with external storage**:
   - The app requires read/write permissions to external storage
   - These are properly declared in AndroidManifest.xml

3. **F-Droid build errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are compatible with F-Droid's build environment
   - Verify the app builds with openjdk-21-jdk-headless
